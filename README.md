<h2 align="left">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

  I'm a web designer and JS/TS developer. I plan to learn Swift soon. I'm also concerned about my privacy so don't bother searching for me on Facebook since I don't have account there.

<h3>What browser is my favorite?</h3>

<h3>iOS or Android</h3>
<p>Well it's hard to tell for me. iOS and Android are equally good mobile operating systems.</p>
